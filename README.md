## About

Denite.nvim is a dark powered Neovim unite all interfaces.

Note: This is the my next vaporware!

## Requirements

denite requires Neovim with if\_python3.
If `:echo has("python3")` returns `1`, then you're done; otherwise, see below.

You can enable Python3 interface with pip:

    pip3 install neovim

If you want to read the Neovim-python/python3 interface install documentation,
you should read `:help nvim-python`.

## Future works (not implemented yet)

* All
